4.1 Creators
As a creator, you are responsible for providing accurate, truthful, and complete information about your project. You must clearly outline the funding goal, timeline, and how the funds will be used. You are also responsible for delivering the promised rewards to backers if your project is funded.

As a backer, you acknowledge that your contribution is a pledge, and you will not receive a refund unless specified in the event of a failed or canceled project. By making a pledge, you understand that the creator may not be able to fulfill the project or reward as promised.

4.3 Failed Funding
If a project does not reach its funding goal by the specified deadline, no funds will be collected from backers, and the project will be considered failed.

5. Payments
Payments are processed through third-party payment processors. You agree to provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By backing a project, you authorize us to charge your selected payment method for the pledged amount upon the project's successful funding.

6. Project Content and Intellectual Property
Creators retain ownership of their intellectual property and content, but by posting a project on the Platform, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display, promote, and distribute your project on the Platform.
